# Molten Sims 🧫

Using [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD/) to simulate the [Molten Finance](https://github.com/butterymoney/molten) workflow.

Agents act based on set "probablilities", which are randomized by set ranges on each simulation run.

The logic and [policies](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/development-recommendations/solidity-specific/assert-require-revert/) they abide by are based on the [Molten Funding Contract](https://github.com/butterymoney/molten/blob/main/src/MoltenFunding.sol) logic.
